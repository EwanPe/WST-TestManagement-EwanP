Wow, hi. I am Ewan P, I enjoy a lot of horror games, and atmospheric adventure games. Some of the games I really enjoyed were: Signalis, Dead Space, and Silent Hill. I have played some other games that were alright, but not as good as the above, such as: Oneshot, Outer Wilds, Milk Outside a bag of Milk Outside a bag of Milk, and Lobotomy Corporation.
I am in the morning session; and I am in this class because I wanted to learn how to make 3d models of characters that I liked.
